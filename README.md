## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Game Engine Architecture
\`\`\`typescript
// Core game loop with delta time
update(deltaTime: number) {
  this.updatePlayers(deltaTime)
  this.updateProjectiles(deltaTime)
  this.updatePhysics(deltaTime)
  this.checkCollisions()
  this.updateParticles(deltaTime)
}
\`\`\`

### Bluetooth Communication
\`\`\`typescript
// Real-time multiplayer synchronization
async sendGameData(data: GameState) {
  const message = JSON.stringify(data)
  await this.characteristic.writeValue(encoder.encode(message))
}
\`\`\`

### Physics System
\`\`\`typescript
// Realistic movement with momentum
player.velocity.x += Math.cos(player.rotation) * thrust * deltaTime
player.position.x += player.velocity.x * deltaTime * 60
player.velocity.x *= 0.98 // Apply drag
\`\`\`
